# Ink.el

Insert images in a LaTeX document using inkscape. You can insert a new figure at point using ink-make-figure or edit an existing figure with ink-edit-figure. This is pretty rough so use at your own risk. This assumes you have Inkscape installed. And you should have `\usepackage{import}` in your preamble.
